# cutie-hack-2021
This is my very first project and my submission to Cutie Hack 2021. 
It contains two lists I created of insulting adjectives and nouns. 
The generator randomly selects a adjective and noun from the list, and calls the user this unique insult. 
The program asks the user only for a Y/N input, if an invalid answer is provided, it will insult them further.
